**Portfolio Website**
 
Welcome to my portfolio website repository! This website was created using HTML and CSS and is designed to showcase my projects, skills, and experience as a student and beginner in the field of web development. I used a template as a starting point to build this website, but I made several modifications and customization to make it my own.

I hope you find this website informative and visually appealing. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me. Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
